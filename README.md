# Arithmetic Calculator REST API

## Project Description

The Arithmetic Calculator REST API is a web platform designed to provide simple calculator functionalities, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root calculation, and random string generation. Each functionality incurs a specific cost per request, which is deducted from the user's starting credit/balance. If a user's balance is insufficient to cover the request cost, the request will be denied.

This project consists of a RESTful API built using Express.js and a front-end UI application. Both applications are hosted live on a platform of choice and can be configured and used locally by other developers. Detailed instructions are provided to facilitate this setup.

## Key Features

- **Calculator Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root calculation, and random string generation.
- **User Balance Reset**: The Balance can be reset up to 100 as many times as you want.
- **Record list**: The record list allows you to view, filter, order and delete existing records.

# Getting Started with Create React App to run it locally:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
